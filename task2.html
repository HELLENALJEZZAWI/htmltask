   <h1>Petra</h1> 
   <p>The beautiful "Rose City,
    " which is half-carved and half-built and was once known as Raqmu,
     is located between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea.
    Petra is not only known for its famous hewn-in-the-rock monuments but it 
    is also one of the greatest sites in Jordan to visit for hikers and nature enthusiasts,
     with several walks over the cliffs and into the deep valleys inside the site.</p>
